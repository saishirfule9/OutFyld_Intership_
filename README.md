# OutFyld Internship

This repository contains all the tasks, projects, and learning work completed during my Full Stack Developer Internship at OutFyld. I use this space to upload weekly tasks, notes, code updates, and practice files that I work on throughout the internship.

## About the Internship

I am working as a Full Stack Developer Intern where I handle Java, Spring Boot, React, SQL, and general full stack tasks. The goal of this repository is to track my progress, maintain clean code, and show my daily learning activity.

## What You Will Find Here

• Weekly task submissions  
• Backend development work in Java and Spring Boot  
• Frontend practice tasks in React  
• SQL queries and database related tasks  
• Notes and explanations for tools used during the internship  
• Small demo projects and practice modules  

## Purpose of This Repository

This repo helps me keep everything organized during the internship. It also acts as a record of what I have learned and the work I have completed. Recruiters can use this to review my progress and coding style.

## How I Work

I update this repository regularly with commits for each task. I maintain clear folder names and separate weeks for better understanding.
